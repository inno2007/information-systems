# System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to plan, analyze, design, develop, and implement information systems. It ensures that systems meet both technical and business needs.

---

## 1. Why Use the SDLC?

- Provides a step-by-step framework
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers
- Reduces risk, cost, and development time
- Ensures system alignment with business goals

---

## 2. Stages of the SDLC

| Stage            | Purpose                                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Planning**   | Identify business need; define scope and resources       |
| **2. Analysis**   | Gather requirements; study existing systems              |
| **3. Design**     | Architect the system (interface, database, process flow)|
| **4. Development**| Code and build the system components                     |
| **5. Testing**    | Verify functionality, performance, and security         |
| **6. Implementation** | Deploy system and train users                      |
| **7. Maintenance**| Fix bugs, add features, keep system updated              |

These stages may be followed sequentially (Waterfall model) or iteratively (Agile).

## 3. Roles in System Development

| Role         | Responsibility                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Analyst**   | Gathers requirements and models the system   |
| **User**      | Provides input and feedback; uses the system |
| **Developer** | Implements and tests the technical solution  |
| **Project Manager** | Oversees resources, schedule, and deliverables |

---

## 4. Triggers for System Development

A new system may be proposed when:

- Business needs change
- Technology becomes outdated
- User complaints increase
- Opportunities for efficiency or automation arise

---

## 5. Feasibility Analysis

Before building a system, its **feasibility** is assessed in key areas:

| Type               | Question Addressed                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Operational**     | Will it work in the real-world environment?                 |
| **Technical**       | Do we have the skills and infrastructure to build it?       |
| **Economic**        | Will it be cost-effective? ROI, cost-benefit analysis       |
| **Schedule**        | Can it be completed on time?                                |
| **Legal/Ethical**   | Are there legal, privacy, or ethical concerns?              |

A feasibility study helps reduce project risk before committing resources.

## 6. SDLC vs Agile

| SDLC (Waterfall)           | Agile                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sequential                 | Iterative & Incremental       |
| Rigid stages               | Flexible sprints               |
| Document-driven            | Prototype and feedback-based  |
| Works well for stable systems | Ideal for evolving systems |

---

## Summary

- The SDLC offers a reliable roadmap for system creation and improvement.
- Each stage builds upon the last to ensure the system is usable and aligned with goals.
- Analysts and users play a key role throughout the cycle.
- Feasibility analysis ensures resources are spent on viable projects.
