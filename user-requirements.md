# User Requirements

User requirements describe what the system **must do** and how it should **perform** from a user’s perspective. Clear, accurate requirements ensure that the final system meets business needs and expectations.

## 1. What Are Requirements?

- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
  - E.g., “The system must allow users to reset their password.”
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: How the system should perform
  - E.g., “The system should respond within 2 seconds.”

## 2. Types of Requirements

| Category               | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Functional**         | Features and operations of the system              |
| **Non-Functional**     | Usability, performance, security, availability     |
| **Business**           | High-level goals and outcomes                      |
| **Technical**          | Constraints based on platforms, infrastructure     |
| **Interface**          | How users interact with the system                 |
| **Regulatory**         | Compliance with laws or standards                  |

## 3. Prioritizing Requirements

Requirements are often grouped into:

| Priority     | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Must Have**| Essential; system cannot function without it  |
| **Should Have** | Important but not urgent                   |
| **Could Have**  | Useful but optional                        |
| **Won’t Have**  | Not needed now (for future releases)       |

This approach is known as **MoSCoW** prioritization.

## 4. Gathering Requirements

### Common Techniques:

| Method      | Use Case                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Interviews** | Direct, detailed feedback from users     |
| **Surveys**    | Collect feedback from a large group      |
| **Workshops**  | Interactive, collaborative sessions       |
| **Observation**| Watch users interact with current systems|
| **Document Review** | Analyze existing procedures or reports |

Always involve a **diverse set of users** to capture different needs.

## 5. Writing Good Requirements

Requirements should be:

- **Clear**: No ambiguity
- **Testable**: You can check if they’re met
- **Traceable**: Linked to goals or features
- **Prioritized**: Ranked by business value

### Bad Example:
> "The system should be user-friendly."

### Better Example:
> "The login page must load within 3 seconds and allow password recovery."

## 6. Managing Requirements Changes

Requirements often evolve. Track changes using:

- Version control
- Requirement logs
- Traceability matrices

---

## Summary

- Functional and non-functional requirements define what a system must deliver and how it should behave.
- Gathering accurate requirements requires listening to users through interviews, surveys, and observation.
- Prioritizing requirements helps manage scope and expectations.
