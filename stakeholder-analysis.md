# Stakeholder Analysis & System Users

Understanding the roles and needs of stakeholders is critical in system design. Stakeholder analysis ensures that the system aligns with business goals, user needs, and organizational values.

## 1. Who Are Stakeholders?

**Stakeholders** are individuals or groups that:
- Are involved in the system
- Are affected by the system
- Influence system development

### Examples:
- Internal: Employees, managers, IT department
- External: Customers, suppliers, government, regulators

## 2. Types of System Participants

| Role            | Description                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Users**        | People who interact directly with the system (e.g., staff, students) |
| **Actors**       | Anyone who provides or receives data from the system        |
| **Owners**       | Decision-makers who fund and oversee the system             |
| **Developers**   | Analysts, designers, and coders building the system         |

## 3. Rich Picture Diagrams

A **Rich Picture** is a visual tool that shows the relationships, problems, and structure of a system’s environment.

- Informal and diagrammatic (not a flowchart)
- Used early in the system development process
- Helps understand messy, real-world problems
- Often includes:
  - People
  - Emotions (frustration, delays)
  - Technologies
  - Interactions and conflicts

---

### Example Elements in a Rich Picture:

- Customer unhappy with order system
- Sales team delays due to manual input
- Warehouse errors from miscommunication

This allows you to visualize problems before designing solutions.

## 4. System & Human Synergy

Systems don’t operate alone — they work with people and processes. A well-designed system supports:
- User goals and tasks
- Business process efficiency
- Communication across departments

---

## 5. Importance of Stakeholder Analysis

Without identifying and involving key stakeholders:
- Requirements may be incorrect or incomplete
- The system might not be accepted or used
- Critical risks and constraints may be missed

Stakeholder engagement is continuous across the SDLC (requirements, design, testing, deployment).

---

## Summary

- Stakeholders include all users, influencers, and decision-makers in a system.
- Identifying stakeholder needs ensures system relevance and usability.
- Tools like rich pictures help visualize messy system environments.
- System success depends on synergy between human and technical actors.
