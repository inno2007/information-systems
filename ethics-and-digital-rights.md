## 2. The PAPA Framework (Richard Mason)

A widely used model to examine ethical concerns in the digital world:

| Pillar        | Concern Area                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Privacy**   | Who controls personal data and how it’s used?    |
| **Accuracy**  | Is data correct, complete, and up to date?       |
| **Property**  | Who owns the data, software, or content?         |
| **Accessibility** | Who has access to digital services and resources? |

## 3. ACS Code of Professional Conduct

The **Australian Computer Society (ACS)** code outlines key ethical guidelines for IT professionals.

### Core Values:

| Value               | Description                                                |

| **Public Interest**   | Protect human rights and community safety                  |
| **Quality of Life**   | Enhance well-being of individuals and society              |
| **Honesty**           | Be truthful and transparent in professional duties         |
| **Competence**        | Work within areas of expertise; commit to ongoing learning |
| **Professional Development** | Stay current in your field                     |
| **Ethical Practice**  | Act with integrity and uphold ethical responsibilities     |

These values apply when:
