# Interface Design & Usability

Effective system interfaces are essential for user satisfaction and productivity. This topic explores principles from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), types of interfaces, and how to evaluate usability.

## 1. What Is Interface Design?

**Interface design** involves creating screens, inputs, outputs, and interactions that allow users to effectively operate a system.

A good interface is:
- Easy to use
- Efficient to navigate
- Intuitive and accessible

## 2. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

**HCI** is the study of how people interact with computers. It focuses on designing systems that accommodate human strengths and limitations.

## 3. Types of User Interfaces

| Type             | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Command-line** | Users type commands (e.g., terminal)   |
| **Graphical (GUI)** | Point-and-click with icons, windows |
| **Touch**        | Mobile and tablet interfaces            |
| **Voice/Audio**  | Voice assistants, speech-based systems |
| **Gesture**      | Motion-based interaction (e.g., VR)    |

## 4. Key Design Principles (HCI)

| Principle         | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Affordance**    | Controls look like what they do (e.g., a button looks clickable) |
| **Consistency**   | Similar actions look and behave similarly            |
| **Feedback**      | The system gives clear responses to user actions     |
| **Visibility**    | Important options and information are clearly seen   |
| **Error Prevention** | Avoid designs that lead to mistakes              |
| **User Control**  | Users feel in control and can undo mistakes          |

## 5. Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Forms, dropdowns, sliders, buttons, speech
- Outputs: Tables, messages, charts, audio, vibrations

Design inputs to match the user's task. E.g., for dates use a date picker, not a text box.

## 6. Usability Evaluation

Usability means how easy and pleasant a system is to use.

### Common Testing Methods:

| Method             | Description                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Heuristic Evaluation** | Experts evaluate design using best practices |
| **User Testing**        | Users attempt tasks while observers record issues |
| **Surveys & Feedback**  | Users report satisfaction or confusion     |

### Usability Goals:
- Efficient: Minimal steps
- Learnable: Easy to understand
- Memorable: Easy to return to after time away
- Error-tolerant: Easy to recover from mistakes

## 7. Prototypes

A **prototype** is an early model of a system for testing ideas.

| Type           | Description                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Low-fidelity** | Sketches or wireframes; fast and disposable      |
| **High-fidelity**| Clickable, interactive, closely resembles final UI |

Start with low-fidelity to gather feedback quickly, then refine.

---

## Summary

- Interface design balances usability, clarity, and user expectations.
- HCI principles guide design toward intuitive and efficient systems.
- Usability testing ensures real users can successfully use the system.
- Prototyping is key to refining before final implementation.
